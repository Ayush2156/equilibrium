I have simulated the phenomenon of chemical equilibrium using two distinct methods, independently developed by me, Ayush Kumar, and my friend, Yash Kasana, under the guidance of Dr. Sanjoy Dutta. The simulation involves 1000 particles in a two-dimensional box, divided into two compartments, with the equilibrium state determined by the distribution of particles between the compartments. I further explored the effect of varying the breadth of the compartments by making one compartment longer. Interestingly, the system still reached equilibrium with approximately 500 particles in each compartment, regardless of the size disparity. This behavior aligns with the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), as the random movements and interactions of the particles result in a stable, normally distributed particle distribution at equilibrium. The CLT explains why the equilibrium state is robust, demonstrating that the macroscopic properties of the system are unaffected by microscopic fluctuations.
